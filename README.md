## Documentation:
This webpage is my portfolio which I have created using Markdown & the Cayman Jekyll theme.

It covers my educational qualifications in detail, my areas of interest, my strong points, my skills and my hobbies.
I have also described the projects I have completed and the ones I am working on currently.

My certificates are connected by links to their respective locations in my Google Drive.
I have uploaded screenshots of my projects and put them on my portfolio to give a better idea of the work I have done.

This portfolio can help the interviewers and recruiters to get a glimpse of my personality, my potential, my capabilities and my achievements so far.
This in turn would increase my chances of landing interesting, challenging and rewarding opportunities.

My contact details are also mentioned for future communication.
