## Documentation:
The project is my portfolio.

I have mentioned my projects, skills, current endeavours, certifications, volunteer work, education, hobbies & ways to contact me.
I have used Markdown & the Cayman Jekyll theme on my site.
My certificates are connected to the site by links to the respective locations in my Google Drive.
I have uploaded screenshots of my projects and put them on my portfolio as well to give a better idea of the work I have done.

This project can help the interviewers and recruiters to get a better understanding of who I am and all that I can do and have accomplished so far. Thus, it can help me get better internships & jobs.
