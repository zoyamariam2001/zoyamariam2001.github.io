## *About Me:*
Hello!
I'm currently a second-year student, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from a reputed college in Pune, India, which is also known as the Oxford of the East. Although my prime area of interest is programming, I also enjoy learning about different fields & exploring different domains. I have been told that I have good leadership skills & that I am good at planning & executing the plans efficiently, involving all my team-mates where everyone's opinion is taken into consideration. I immensely enjoy challenges & enjoy those projects and exercises which push me to my limits. Public speaking is another of my forte.

## *Internships:*
#### [Web Development](https://hand-in-hand-ngo.000webhostapp.com/) -
- I made a website for an NGO as part of my internship for AnsrCoach in the month of January 2022.
- The site has details about the NGO "Hand In Hand" such as the services provided by it and ways to contact the team.
- Razorpay has been integrated to collect donations from the user, too.
- I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, SQL, PHP in the site.

## *Projects:*
#### 1. Voice Assistant -
![Voice Assistant In Action](/images/voice.jpg)

- I have designed this voice assistant using Python language which gives information found on Wikipedia, launches YouTube, helps search stuff on Google, tells the current date and time, plays music, launches Stackoverflow, performs simple calculations, reads documents, plays rock-paper-scissor with the user, tells jokes, & reads out the text entered by the user.
- I have used Google APIs to convert speech into text, the 'pyttsx3' module to give voices, the 'os' module, the 'random' module, the 'pyjokes' module, & the 'webbrowser' module in this program.
- The program greets the user upon being called & then performs the tasks told to it.
- The picture above is of my voice assitant in action, & here you can see it performing a mathematical calculation.

#### 2. [Obstacle Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/562624419) -
![Game In Action](/images/game.jpg)

- I have created this game using Scratch in which the user has to use arrow keys to move and jump over obstacles; and on clearing various paths, the player advances to higher levels.
- The picture I have included above is of the first frame of the game.

#### 3. Site For Internships -
![Site Home Page](/images/site.jpg)

- I have developed a website on the lines of the currently available site, Internshala, through which people can sign-up for internships in their areas of interest.

- The picture I have included is a segment of the home page.
