## *About Me:*
Hello!
I'm currently a second-year student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from a reputed college in Pune, India, which is also known as the Oxford of the East. Although my area of interest is programming, I also enjoy learning about different fields & exploring different domains. I'm good at planning and executing various things & taking charge & leading teams. Projects & exercises which challenge me and push me to my limits are what I enjoy immensely. Public speaking & leadership qualities are my forte.

## *Projects:*
#### 1. Voice Assistant -
![Voice Assistant In Action](/images/voice.jpg)

- I have designed a voice assistant using Python language which gives information according to Wikipedia, launches YouTube, opens & looks up stuff on Google, tells the current date and time, plays music, launches Stackoverflow, performs simple calculations, reads documents, plays rock-paper-scissor with the user, tells jokes, & reads out the text entered by the user.
- I used Google APIto convert speech into text, the 'pyttsx3' module to give voices, the 'os' module, the 'random' module, the 'pyjokes' module, & the 'webbrowser' module in my program.
- The program greets the user upon being called & then performs the action told to it.
- The picture I have put above is of the assitant in action & it is performing a math calculation in it.

#### 2. [Obstacle Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/562624419) -
![Game In Action](/images/game.jpg)

- I have created a game using Scratch in which the user has to use arrow keys to move and jump over obstacles and as he clears various paths, he advances to higher levels.
- The picture I have included above is of how the game looks like when you begin to play it.
#### 3. [Clone Site Of Internshala](https://internshala-twin.000webhostapp.com/) -
![Site Home Page](/images/site.jpg)
